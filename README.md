Note: The *.tiff file is for the paper "Vegetation promotes flow retardation and retention in deltaic wetlands" Zhang et al., 2023
1. *tiff file has 6 layers of composited raster data, including dhdt from UAVSAR measurement, deltaT, Lowest water level, vegetation classes, NDVI, DEM. These layers are in 10x10 m resolution.
2. The emprical algorithm developed is based on relationship between water level change, time delay and lowest water level at 6 field observation sites in 2014. See details in the supplymentary file.
